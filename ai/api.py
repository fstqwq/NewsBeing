Lyrics
I couldn't wait for you to come clear the cupboards
But now you're going to leave with nothing but a sign
Another evening I'll be sitting reading in between your lines
Because I miss you all the time
So, get away
Another way to feel what you didn't want yourself to know
And let yourself go
You know you didn't lose your self-control
Let's start at the rainbow
Turn away
Another way to be where you didn't want yourself to go
Let yourself go
Is that a compromise?
So, what do you wanna do, what's your point-of-view?
There's a party soon, do you wanna go?
A handshake with you, what's your point-of-view?
I'm on top of you, I don't wanna go
'Cause I really wanna stay at your house
And I hopе this works out
But you know how much you broke me apart
I'm done with you, I'm ignoring you
I don't wanna know
And I'm awarе that you were lying in the gutter
'Cause I did everything to be there by your side-ide
So, when you tell me I'm the reason I just can't believe the lies
And why do I so want to call you (call you, call you, call you)
So, what do you wanna do, what's your point-of-view?
There's a party soon, do you wanna go?
A handshake with you, what's your point-of-view?
I'm on top of you, I don't wanna go
'Cause I really wanna stay at your house
And I hope this works out
But you know how much you broke me apart
I'm done with you, I'm ignoring you
I don't wanna know
Oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I don't know why I'm no one
So, get away
Another way to feel what you didn't want yourself to know
And let yourself go
You know you didn't lose your self-control
Let's start at the rainbow
Turn away
Another way to be where you didn't want yourself to go
Let yourself go
Is that a compromise?
So, what do you wanna do, what's your point-of-view?
There's a party soon, do you wanna go?
A handshake with you, what's your point-of-view?
I'm on top of you, I don't wanna go

    'Microsoft and the Xbox platform had to make a statement at this year’s E3. The show we saw on June 10, however, has us very excited for the future of Xbox. In addition to announcing several new exclusives from fan-favorite series, Microsoft has significantly bolstered its internal development studios so it can release great exclusives on a regular basis. Here are the announcements Microsoft made during the Xbox E3 2018 press conference.\nHead of Xbox Phil Spencer revealed the commitment Microsoft is making to first-party exclusive games during the press conference. Alongside the new studio The Initiative, based in Santa Monica, Microsoft has acquired State of Decay 2 developer Undead Labs, Forza Horizon 4 studio Playground Games, Hellblade studio Ninja Thoery, and We Happy Few studio Compulsion Games.\nSpeaking of We Happy Few, it’s almost here! The game launches on August 10 for Xbox One, PC, and PlayStation 4.\nMicrosoft took a moment to touch on new cloud game streaming options, as well, which the company plans to bring to a variety of less powerful devices in the future. Phil Spencer also revealed that system architects have begun work on the next Xbox, but he didn’t elaborate on what form that will take.\nWe predicted Microsoft and 343 Studios could announce the sixth Halo game during the press conference, but it won’t be called “Halo 6.” Halo Infinite is the next chapter of the story, once again following Master Chief. It’s being created with the new “Slipspace Engine,” designed in-house for future Halo games, and will release on both Xbox One and Windows 10.\nOur first look at Halo Infinite didn’t give us too many details on the story or characters, but we caught a glimpse of several forms of wildlife including deer and rhinocerous-like creatures. We also saw the famous Warthog vehicle, as well as a titular Halo ring – something the Legendary ending of Halo 5 alluded to.\nThe Coalition is working on the next chapter in the Gears of War saga, which was only called Gears 5 in its announcement trailer. The game will star Kait Diaz rather than JD Fenix this time around, 
though JD, Marcus, and Del all return.\nThe trailer showed off a variety of environments, including areas filled with trees, frozen lakes, ravines, and one section covered in red sand. Enemies also show variety, 
and a giant troll-like monster attacks with dual clubs – which you can turn against them.\nGears 5 comes to Xbox One and PC in 2019.\nAlongside Gears 5, The Coalition announced a collaborative project with Funko 
and MediaTonic, Gears Pop. It turns the game’s famous characters into Funko Pop figures, and will be available on iOS and Android in 2019. No gameplay details were shared.\nThe Gears of War series will enter the 
turn-based strategy genre for the first time in Gears Tactics. Developed for PC – Xbox One was not mentioned – the Splash Damage-developed title mixes the characters, weapons, and environments from the series with turn-based tactics. It takes place 12 years before the events of the first game, and your squad and equipment will both be customizable.\nWe got a new look at gameplay from Ori and the Will of the Wisps, and it looks like it will expand on everything that made the original game so fantastic. In the video shown during the conference, we see Ori teaming up with a small owl-like bird – possibly the bird that hatches at the end of the previous game – and fly on top of it to avoid hazards. Ori will have access to a more brutal melee attack as well as a bow, and there also appear to be minecart-style obstacles similar to those in the Donkey Kong Country games.\nThat short teaser for a new From Software game shown late last year was not a Bloodborne sequel, as we had anticipated. Instead, it was for Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, a game that mixes together Japanese folklore with the studio’s legendary third-person combat. The character we see in the trailer, presumably the protagonist, has had all the skin and muscle taken off of his left arm, leaving only bone, but it doesn’t slow down his ability to leap through the air and deliver devastating attacks to monsters. Enemies have tricks up their sleeves, as well, and make use of whips and horses in combat.\nSekiro: Shadows Die Twice will release in 2019 and is being published by Activision.\nBethesda Game Studios’ Todd Howard took the stage to talk about Fallout 76 ahead of Bethesda’s own conference later that day. Howard did not disclose the genre of the game – we’ve heard rumors it’s an online survival title – but did share that its world is four times the size of Fallout 4. It will be available to pre-order on June 15. Also, Fallout 4 is now available as part of the Xbox Game Pass program.\nSquare Enix made a surprise Life is Strange announcement during Microsoft’s show, revealing the free The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit. Available June 26, it stars an imaginative boy named Chris who has dreams of becoming a superhero and venturing into outer space. Unlike Life is Strange: Before the Storm, it’s being developed by original creators Dontnod Entertainment. It managed to tug at our heartstrings in just a few minutes.\nAlongside a new trailer for Crackdown 3, which starred Terry Crews and showed off the game’s over-the-top action, Microsoft reiterated that the game will now release in February 2019. The video shown included giant mech enemies, “mad scientists,” and an enormous centipede-looking creature that had wrapped itself around a skyscraper. Terry Crews’ character also appears to have access to a gun that fires rubber ducks, and we’re way into that.\nMicrosoft and Square Enix confirmed that Nier: Automata will be coming to Xbox One on June 26, complete 
with its expansion and several pieces of cosmetic DLC. The game launches on the platform June 26.\n4A Games and Deep Silver gave Metro fans a lengthy gameplay demonstration for Metro Exodus, showing off the mutant humans, sharks, and unrecognizable monstrosities that Artyom will be battling in his mission to save the world from total collapse. A train quickly moves survivors across the surface of the Russian rubble, as the game will not actually focus on the titular subway station this time around.\nMetro Exodus launches on February 22, 2019.\nSquare Enix showed off a new gameplay demonstration for Kingdom Hearts III, including 
a look at the world inspired by Disney’s Frozen. Elsa and Olaf make an appearance, and Sora has access to new ice-based weapons and abilities to take down his enemies. Characters from Tangled also make an appearance, as do those from Toy Story and Monsters, Inc.\nKingdom Hearts III is out January 29, 2019. Check out our hands-on preview.\nRare’s Sea of Thieves will be getting two new expansions this year, which look to expand on the base game’s vision with dangerous and exciting new content. The teaser we were shown features a red orb showing off the “Forsaken Shores,” filled with craggily rocks that we’ll undoubtedly crash into.\nSea of Thieves: Cursed Sails will launch in July, while Sea of Thieves: Forsaken Shores will launch in September.\nAs promised by Electronic Arts yesterday, the conference included a very small taste of the Battlefield V campaign. We’re introduced to Nordly, a Norwegian resistance fighter fighting to rid her country of German occupation. It’s one of several “War Stories” included in the game, similar to what Battlefield 1 did in 2016.\nBattlefield V is out October 19. Check out our hands-on preview.\nPlayground Games, now a Microsoft first-party studio, is once again in charge of the Forza series for Forza Horizon 4. The open-world racer takes players to Great Britain, where they’ll be able to experience dynamic weather and seasons. Areas we saw included frozen lakes, the countryside, dunes, and snowy, dangerous roads. This time around, the entire game world will be shared by all players, and they can cooperate to complete challenges, On Xbox One X, the game will run at 60 frames per second, a first for the Horizon games on console.\nForza Horizon 4 is out for Xbox One and PC October 2, and it’s included with Xbox Game Pass at launch.\nPlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds on Xbox One will soon get “Sanhok,” the map currently being tested for the Steam version of the game. The respawn-enabled “War” mode is also on the way to Xbox One, and Xbox players can expect to play a new snow-covered map this winter.\nUbisoft chose not to wait for its own press conference to show the first gameplay for Tom Clancy’s The Division 2. The action moves from New York City to Washington, D.C. for the sequel, and takes place six months after the outbreak that killed much of humanity. In the demonstration, agents fight with heavily armored enemies outside a crashed Air Force One plane, and it appears we’ll be able to target certain body parts to damage enemies more severely this time around. There is 
also some degree of environmental destruction, as a character is trapped in rock before being freed with a few bullets.\nThe Division 2 is out March 15, 2019.\nSquare Enix showed off Shadow of the Tomb Raider during the press conference, giving us a chance to see some of the game’s dangerous puzzles and cinematic escape sequences. Lara appears to have accidentally triggered the apocalypse, and as a town is flooded with raging water, she is nearly crushed by a falling bell tower. Jonah, who we saw in both previous games, will be making a return, but Lara’s enemies are more dangerous than her friends – she’ll have to go up against a leopard.\nShadow of the Tomb Raider is out on September 14. Check out our hands-on preview.\nDante and demons are back in Devil May Cry 5, the long-awaited sequel from veteran developer Hideaki Itsuno and Capcom. It appears to star Nero, as well, who is featured more heavily in the teaser trailer. The game’s tone seems to be darker than past games – it reminded us of Ninja Theory’s DmC: Devil May Cry – but it still retains the humor we expect. According to Itsuno, it’s the best game he’s ever made, and it is being developer with fans in mind before anything else.\nIf you loved last year’s cartoony action-platformer run-and-gun Cuphead, more of it is on the way. Cuphead in the Delicious Last Course is an expansion for the original game that includes access to a new playable isle, new bosses, new weapons, and new abilities. In addition to Cuphead and Mugman, it also introduces Ms. Chalice as a playable character.\nCuphead in the Delicious Last Course is out for Xbox One and PC in 2019.\nDeveloped by tiny studio Finji, Tunic is an action-adventure game starring an adorable Fox, and the gameplay trailer shown during the press conference reminded us of old-school Zelda games. The combat has a much quicker pace, however, with enemies’ attacks requiring quick reflexes. Its visuals are both detailed and simple, and the creatures we saw suggest something sinister in store for players.\nIf you’ve ever wanted to see Dragon Ball Z, Naruto, and One Piece characters battle together in a universe-colliding action game, then Bandai Namco have you covered with Jump Force. The exact reason for these series blending together remains unclear, but we do know you’ll be able to give Frieza a good whooping.\nJump Force is out in 2019.\nTechland’s Chris Avellone took the stage to show off Dying Light 2, an ambitious sequel that looks to build on the original in a big way. This time around, nearly 
every decision you make in the zombie apocalypse will have a lasting effect on the world around you. In the gameplay demonstration shown, it’s explained that helping out certain peacekeepers nearby can give citizens access to clean water and the area will subsequently begin to rebuild, but you can also thumb your nose at morality and battle against them, instead. There will also be dialogue choices, and Techland ensures 
no two players’ games will be alike.\nYes, it’s 2018 and we’re getting a new Battletoads. Featuring three-player couch cooperative play and a 2.5D visual style, it will support 4K resolution and looks to continue the goofy beat-‘em-up antics of the original game.\nBattletoads is coming in 2019.\nA Steam advertisement spilled the beans on this one a little early, but Avalanche Studios and Square Enix revealed Just Cause 4 during Microsoft’s show. The game will once again star Rico in his fight against the private Black Hand army, and it will feature wingsuits, gunships, drones, and enough explosive weaponry to level an entire country. The previous game suffered performance issues on consoles, so we’re hoping the issues have been ironed out for the sequel.\nJust Cause 4 is out December 4.\nMicrosoft closed its show with a look at CD Projekt Red’s Cyberpunk 2077, which literally took over the conference by “hacking” into the screen. In the world premiere of the game, we’re shown the studio’s dystopic vision, which mixes widespread crime with flying cards, androids, and at least one man bun. Protagonist V is a “hired gun on the rise” in Night City, and he’s attempting to make it as an elite mercenary and, most likely, engage in a series of well-written side quests.\nCyberpunk 2077 is an extremely violent game, and we see nearly every character in the trailer pick up a weapon and attempt to kill something. We can’t wait to learn more and find out who’s still standing, but no release date was given during the trailer.\nThe following games were mentioned either during Microsoft’s sizzle reel or in passing over the course of the conference.', 'Your WIRED daily briefing. Today, Labour\'s position on Brexit may have played a key role in attaining a hung parliament, SoftBank is to buy Boston Dynamics from Google parent Alphabet, Comey testimony reveals that the FBI was aware of Russian 
electoral interference as early as 2015 and more.\nFollowing the news that the General Election has resulted in a hung parliament, it\'s become clear that that the hard Brexit, hard austerity and hard anti-encryption stance of Theresa May\'s Conservative Party failed to resonate with a majority of Britain\'s voters (WIRED). Voters were tired of Brexit, polls showed. The 48 per cent did not exist. All this was good news for Labour because they didn’t have a view on Brexit. The party\'s vagueness appeared at best weak, at worst downright foolish. In fact, it could have been a strategic masterstroke. Political scientists have long 
argued that the way to win elections is to be on the most popular side of divisive issues. Now, on this defining question, Labour represented the centre. Labour was aided by May’s disastrous, over-confident campaign, highlighted by the fiasco over the "dementia tax". But, again, underlying all this was Brexit. Brexit was a debate between immigration and the economy – so, logically speaking, if she was for a hard Brexit, 
she couldn’t claim to be strong on the economy. Labour’s traditional image of economic weakness mattered that much less. But if this election shows anything, it’s that people want Brexit, but not too much of it.\nJapanese technology and telecommunications giant SoftBank has agreed to buy Alphabet\'s robotics subsidiaries Boston Dynamics and Schaft for an undisclosed sum (The Verge). Boston Dynamics is best known for heavy-duty bipedal and quadrupedal robots designed for military-grade use in rough terrain, while Schaft is a humanoid robotics specialist that grew out of the JSK Robotics Laboratory at the University of Tokyo. SoftBank is already known for its investment in robotics in the form of the self-consciously cute Pepper robot assistant developed in partnership with Aldebaran Robotics. SoftBank Group CEO Masayoshi Son said: "Today, there are many issues we still cannot solve by ourselves with human capabilities. Smart robotics are going to be a key driver of the next stage of the Information Revolution, and Marc and his team at Boston Dynamics are the clear technology leaders in advanced dynamic robots."\nFormer FBI director James Comey has told a Senate Intelligence hearing that the FBI was aware of interference by Russian hackers from the very 
beginning of the US presidential campaign period (CNET). He described "a massive effort to target government and nongovernmental agencies", which the intelligence agency was aware of as early as late summer 2015. Speaking of Russian cyberattacks intended to interfere with the outcome of the US election, Comey said: "They did it with overwhelming technical efforts, and it was an active-measures campaign driven from the top of the government". Comey was fired last month by US president Donald Trump amid an investigation into connections between Trump\'s Republican administration and the Russian government.\nAs the diplomatic crisis between Qatar and its Middle Eastern neighbours worsens, Saudi Arabia has made it illegal to repost or press like on any social media post that expresses sympathy for Qatar (Qatar). The law, introduced on Wednesday, June 7, covers both on- and offline expressions of "sympathy" – what constitutes such an expression isn\'t clearly defined – and carries a minimum fine of 500,000 Dirhams (£105,162) and a maximum prison sentence of 15 years. The diplomatic stand-off, which has seen borders closed and vital food exports to Qatar stopped, was triggered on May 23 when Russian hackers fabricated comments praising Saudi Arabia\'s rival, Iran, and sent them out via official Qatari government channels.\nFacebook has announced a new data visualisation toolkit to help disaster relief workers find people in need of help (The Verge). The company is to create data-driven maps based on the activity of Facebook users in disaster zones, with location density maps to show where people are located before, during and after a disaster; movement maps showing how people are shifting between population centres and regions, and safety check maps, which will use de-identified user data to show where the most and fewest people check in safe, allowing aid organisations to see where there are the largest number of people in need of assistance. The social media giant has teamed up with charities including UNICEF, the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the World Food Programme, who will use the maps to provide help on the ground.\nAstronomers have found traces of chemicals that make up the basic ingredients needed for life in early Sun-like stars, suggesting that the building blocks of life on Earth could have originated from our own star (WIRED). In particular, the prebiotic molecule methyl isocyanate has been discovered for the first time in protostars, huge clumps of gas from which stars form. The molecules could have formed first in the Sun before being transported to Earth, where life evolved. "Either life originated completely on the surface of the Earth, or some building blocks were formed in the solar nebula prior to the formation of the Earth and delivered by comets to our planet, where biochemical reactions continued leading to the formation of the first living organisms," says Rafael Martín-Doménech, from the Centro de Astrobiología in Madrid, Spain.\nMicrosoft has released the latest development build of Windows 10 Fall Creators Update, and the next version of the operating system 
looks set to make some sweeping changes to the operating-system-as-a-service\'s user experience and features (VentureBeat). New additions include the first elements of the improved Fluent Design System user interface; Windows Update now provides streamlined control over both per-user and group policy update; there are upgraded dictation and voice command features, and Cortana can now read posters you\'ve taken photos of 
and suggest setting calendar events based on them. With Microsoft\'s purchase of Hexadite, the company has also revealed that it will be using its new artificial intelligence powered analysis tools to improve the future performance of its increasingly effective Windows Defender anti-malware toolkit.\nCD Projekt Red has announced that design documents for its next game, Cyberpunk 2077 have been stolen and are being held to ransom (Kotaku). The Polish indie powerhouse behind The Witcher games and the GOG digital distribution platform said: "We will not be giving in to the demands of the individual or individuals that have contacted us, which might eventually lead to the files being published online". The developer says that "the documents are old and largely unrepresentative of the current vision for the game", advising fans to stick to official announcements for their information on the forthcoming dystopian sci-fi RPG. There is currently no release date for Cyberpunk 2077, which is based on the Cyberpunk 2020 tabletop role-playing game.\nA year on from its initial release on July 6, 2016, Pokémon Go is getting range of online and real-world events to celebrate (VG24/7). The first Pokémon Go Fest is scheduled to take place in Chicago on July 22, with tickets available from the official site and events in other locations – including London and New York – to be announced over the next couple of months. Meanwhile, all Pokémon Go players will get to take part in the game\'s Summer Solstice event, which will run from June 13 to June 20, with increased fire and ice type encounters. Niantic\'s augmented reality monster-catching sim has been downloaded over 750 million times, 
and the company says it\'s working on new updates including player vs player battles and other "collaborative group gaming features", set to come online shortly after the Solstice celebration.\nOverkill Software\'s hit heist-themed FPS, Payday 2 is currently free on Steam, but only five million copies are available, so you\'ll have to get in fast to claim yours (PC Gamer). The reason behind the decision to make the still-popular 2013 game, which includes support for virtual reality headsets, briefly free is the impending release of Payday 2: Ultimate Edition, which will incorporate all 144 DLC expansions so far released for Payday 2 and make all future DLC free. It\'s no longer possible to get any DLC for the original, currently free, release of the game. Overkill explains that: "Previous DLC is currently being added to the Ultimate Edition which will be available at a later date" and "The price to upgrade will depend on how several factors" – potentially including how much DLC you bought in the past.\nIn Brexit Britain, even the moderates are 
angry. "We need to get back to fighting," says Bess Mayhew. "We have to be militant in our moderation." Mayhew, 30, is the founder and acting CEO of "tech-driven political startup" More United, which backed 49 candidates in yesterday\'s election. Just don\'t call it a political party.', "Open-world games are on top of the heap these days, and CD Projekt Red’s 2015 masterpiece The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is currently the benchmark of open-world games when it comes to size and scope. The Witcher 3 was 30 times as large as The Witcher 2 and 20% bigger than Skyrim, the previous titleholder. Since they started The Witcher series in 2007, CD Projekt Red’s ambition has been on a slingshot trajectory pointed toward outer space, and now it looks as though their next project will continue that journey.\nThe Polish developer’s next game will be Cyberpunk 2077, a game whose name makes no bones about its genre, and will doubtless take players through a vast science fiction world reminiscent of Blade Runner and Shadowrun. In fact, Cyberpunk 2077 will be so large that it might make The Witcher 3 look like a trial run in retrospect.\nIf Texeira is speaking the truth, it’s safe to say that a cyberpunk videogame of 2077’s size and scope has never been done before, and that Cyberpunk 2077 may turn out to be the biggest open world game to ever hit next generation consoles. Most recent open world games have featured either fantasy or contemporary crime settings, so a sprawling cyberpunk open world game is a bold new experiment. However, we think it will be a successful one.\nThough Cyberpunk 2077 doesn’t yet have a release date, we seem to be entering an era of peak popularity for the cyberpunk genre for both videogames and film. Blade Runner 2 is in the works and a live-action production of Akira may yet happen - and Treyarch has embraced cyberpunk elements for the campaign of Call of Duty: Black Ops 3. CD Projekt Red's open world cyberpunk game would seem to be filling a unique niche at just the right time.\nBut genre aside, is there such a thing as too big? Do players want even deeper immersion into virtual worlds, particularly virtual worlds about virtual worlds? Let us know in the comments.\nCyberpunk 2077 does not yet have a release date.", '"Pokémon Sword" and "Pokémon Shield" are the first main-series Pokémon games headed to the Nintendo Switch.\n2019 is shaping up to be a big year in gaming.\nThings are already popping off with the launch of a long-awaited sequel, "Kingdom Hearts 3," which arrived in late January, and the explosively popular "Apex Legends" in March.\nBut that\'s just the beginning - major games are expected in 2019: "The Last of Us: Part II" on PlayStation 4 and a brand new "Pokémon" game for the Nintendo Switch are highlights of the year.\n2018 is fading into the past, and we\'re already in the midst of 2019\'s major video game launches.\nThe year started with a trip into the worlds of Disney with the long-awaited arrival of "Kingdom Hearts 3" in January, followed closely by the surprise announcement and release of the wildly popular "Apex Legends" in March.\nCheck out our full review of "Resident Evil 2" right here.\nAlongside the cast of "Toy Story" (and their Earth-like setting), "Kingdom Hearts 3" also stars Goofy and Donald Duck. You may have noticed a third character here - that\'s "Sora," the main character of "Kingdom Hearts 3" and who you\'ll play as.\nCheck out our full review of "Kingdom Hearts 3" right here.\nYes, it\'s a Battle Royale game. And yes, it\'s a free-to-play game, with all the baggage that phrase comes with.

No gameplay was shown, but that\'s coming 
in January.\nIf "Mad Max" were an ongoing series of video games, it might look something like the "Rage" franchise.\nIt\'s set in a very familiar post-apocalypse, where gangs of extremely theatrical-looking survivors endlessly battle for control of the remaining world around them. There are scrappy-looking off-road vehicles to battle in, and horrific mutated creatures, and a whole bunch of crazy-looking guns.\nIf nothing else, it should provide a fantastic excuse to blow stuff up.\n17. "Super Mario Maker 2"\nOne of the best 2D "Super Mario" games ever made isn\'t just a game, but a creation tool: "Super Mario Maker" on Wii U enabled millions of players to create their own "Super Mario" levels, test them, and then share them all over the world.\nIn June, Nintendo plans to release the second game in that series with "Super Mario Maker 2."\nLike in the first "Super Mario Maker," you\'re able to create your own 2D "Super Mario" levels using objects from a variety of "Super Mario" games - goombas and koopas and chain chomps from across decades of "Super Mario" history.\nWhile the first "Super Mario Maker" offered objects from "Super Mario Bros.," "Super Mario Bros. 3," "Super Mario World," and "New Super Mario Bros. U," it looks like "Super Mario Maker 2" will also allow the use of objects from "Super Mario 3D World" - including the various "suits" from that game.\n18. "Crash Team Racing: Nitro-Fueled"\nRemember "Crash Team Racing"? It was the "Mario Kart" equivalent on PlayStation 1 that some folks swore by, and in 2019 it\'s coming back!\nThe original game is being re-created in loving/ridiculous detail for the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch. In addition to all the original racers and tracks, the new game is getting online racing - something that didn\'t become commonplace in gaming until two full game generations after the original PlayStation 1.\nSince this game\'s a reboot of an older game, it comes with a lower price tag: Just $40.\n"Dr. Mario World" is a free-to-play puzzle game based on the long line of "Dr. Mario" puzzle games from Nintendo. Like previous Nintendo games on smartphones, "Dr. Mario World" is being developed in collaboration with third-party partners - in this case, it\'s the Japanese social media company Line and the Korean game development studio NHN Entertainment.\nSo, uh, what is it? We don\'t know too much just yet, but it sounds like a traditional color-matching puzzle game along the lines of previous "Dr. Mario" games. One twist: It\'ll be free-to-play. Nintendo describes it as, "free to download with optional in-app purchases."\n"Mario Kart" has been a big deal for over 25 years. And now - finally- it\'s coming to smartphones.\nThe game is "Mario Kart Tour," and it\'s now scheduled to arrive at some point this summer.\nSo, what is "Mario Kart Tour"? That remains to be seen - Nintendo has yet to show anything beyond the logo seen above.\nYou can tell from the naming convention that "Mario Kart Tour" is its own thing, separate from the main thread of "Mario Kart" games that have come out on Nintendo consoles exclusively. "Mario Kart 8 Deluxe" is the most recent entry in the main series. "Mario Kart Tour" is expected to be a side game, like "Mario Kart Arcade GP."\nThat the game isn\'t a numbered entry isn\'t the only indication that it\'s a spin-off - the fact that it\'s for a smartphone, not 
one of Nintendo\'s consoles, is another big indicator. We\'ll find out soon enough!\nOn the cusp of the millennium, Sega launched an ambitious third-person action game for its similarly ambitious new game console, the Sega Dreamcast. That game was "Shenmue," and it went on to become a cult classic.\nThe game - and the subsequent franchise it spawned - are known for offering players a level of freedom previously unseen in a console game.\nIn 2019, "Shenmue" is coming back with a brand new entry from the original creators: "Shenmue 3." The game is notorious for having outright broken Kickstarter when it was announced back in 2015. Now, nearly four years later, it\'s nearly here.\nFinally, after years of waiting, "Borderlands 3" was revealed and given a relatively imminent release date.\nThe game franchise that helped popularize the loot-shooter genre is back with a new entry, and it seems like more "Borderlands" in every way: New character classes, new planets to explore, and new guns to fire.\nPerhaps most notable is what "Borderlands 3" isn\'t 
- an online-only loot-shooter along the lines of "Destiny" and "The Division."\nThe creative duo behind the original "Fallout" are working together again on a new series that feels suspiciously familiar: It\'s called "The Outer Worlds."\nThe kitschy first trailer for "The Outer Worlds" is a delight, and follows in the tradition of irreverent role-playing games like "Fallout."\nThe story is simple: "You awake from hibernation on a colonist ship lost in transit to its destination on the edge of the galaxy, only to find yourself in the midst of a deep conspiracy threatening to destroy the colony." How you play out that scenario is 
seemingly up to you.\n24. "The Last of Us: Part 2"\nThe folks behind the Indiana Jones-esque blockbuster third-person action "Uncharted" series are true veterans of video game creation. The studio, Naughty Dog, goes all the way back to the first PlayStation console, having created the beloved "Crash Bandicoot" series.\nBeyond those two (massive) game franchises, Naughty Dog is also responsible for the incredible, genre-pushing PlayStation game "The Last of Us." Naughty Dog\'s next game is a highly anticipated follow-up, the aptly-titled "The Last of Us: Part II."\nIn "Part II," the duo of protagonists Joel and Ellie are making a return.\nIt wasn\'t anything like a typical Super Mario game - instead of jumping on Goombas and clearing treacherous gaps, Luigi was sneaking around a haunted mansion with a flashlight and a vacuum. His goal: Stun the villainous ghosts with his flashlight, then vacuum them up. Naturally!\n26. "Gears of War 5"\nThe next entry in the gruff and grisly "Gears of War" third-person shooter series was announced by Microsoft in June during the company\'s annual E3 media briefing. A new character is at the forefront, introduced during a short trailer - her name is Kait, who previously debuted as a supporting "Gears" character.\nLike previous games in the series, "Gears 5" features third-person shooting with a focus on movement and cover.\nSucker Punch, the studio that created the PlayStation blockbuster "inFamous," is working on something completely new: a samurai game set in Feudal Japan, called "Ghost of Tsushima."\n"The year is 1274. Samurai warriors are the legendary defenders of Japan - until the fearsome Mongol Empire invades the island of Tsushima, wreaking havoc and conquering the local population. As one of the last surviving samurai, you rise from the ashes to fight back. But, honorable tactics won\'t lead you to victory. You must move beyond your samurai traditions to forge a new way of fighting - the way of the Ghost - as you wage an unconventional war for the freedom of Japan."\nFrom what the trailer shows, "Ghost of Tsushima" is a third-person, character-driven action game with a focus on swordplay. This is a samurai game, after all.\nBeyond the story, and the pedigree, "Ghost of Tsushima" simply looks incredibly unique. It\'s gorgeous, and set in a time period rarely explored in blockbuster video games.\n"Cyberpunk 2077" is what happens when you mix "Blade Runner" with "Grand Theft Auto" - an open-world action game set in a dystopian future, where body modification is standard and cold, empty capitalism is the driving force of society.\nHow you choose to live in the world of "Cyberpunk 2077" is up to you. The game is a role-playing game in the truest sense: You create a character and shape who they are through your actions in-game.\nWhether "Cyberpunk 2077" launches in 2019 is anyone\'s guess, but it\'s been in the works for years at this point. Fingers crossed!\nWhat is "Death Stranding"? That\'s a great question. Even though I\'ve seen several trailers for the game, I have no idea what it is.\n- The game is being created by "Metal Gear" series creative lead Hideo Kojima, a legendary figure in the video game business. - It stars Norman Reedus, of "The Walking Dead" fame. He\'s the main character. Mads Mikkelsen, a Danish actor best known as the bad guy from "Casino Royale," appears to be the antagonist. - The game is a collaboration between Hideo Kojima and famed film director Guillermo del Toro. - It\'s being funded by Sony, which means the game is only coming to the PlayStation 4.\nIs it a first-person or third-person game? A survival game? Open world, or linear? All of this stuff is still up in the air. Even after seeing the latest trailer, I\'m no closer to knowing exactly what it is.\nAll that aside, it\'s clearly gorgeous and doing something totally different.\nThe new "Halo" is the next major entry in the long-running first-person shooter series, and it once again features the iconic supersoldier Master Chief as its main protagonist. And "Halo Infinite" is rife with nods to "Halo" tradition.\nBut let\'s be clear: It\'s not named "Halo 6" for a good reason. The game features a new art style, and is said to take the series in "new and unexpected directions."\nBut let\'s not get too crazy: This is still a "Halo" game, and that means that everyone\'s favorite supersoldier, Master Chief, is still front and center. The game\'s story focuses on him, and you playing as him, and - if history serves as a guide here - shooting like a trillion aliens as him.\nRegardless of the name, "Infinite" is a follow-up to "Halo 5: Guardians," and will continue 
the story that began in that game. Given that it\'s been over three years since the last "Halo" game, we expect to see this one in 2019.\n33. "The Legend of Zelda: Link\'s Awakening"\nThe upcoming "Legend of Zelda: Link\'s Awakening" will remaster a classic Game Boy game for the modern era.\nThe Game Boy classic "The Legend of Zelda: Link\'s Awakening" was an incredible achievement when it arrived on Nintendo\'s Game Boy handheld console in 1993. It felt and played almost as well as the Super Nintendo game "The Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past," despite running on far less powerful hardware.\nOver 25 years later, Nintendo is finally giving "Link\'s Awakening" the re-master treatment it deserves: The game is getting a gorgeous update on the Nintendo Switch at some point in 2019.\n34. "Pokémon Sword and Shield"\nPokémon is coming to the 
Nintendo Switch - prepare yourself!\nIndeed, Nintendo is developing "Pokémon Sword" and "Pokémon Shield" for the Nintendo Switch. Not spin-offs, like "Pokémon Stadium" or "Pokémon Snap" way back on the Nintendo 64, but a full-on main series entry. As is typical for main series "Pokémon" games, there are two versions ("Sword" and "Shield").\nThe game is set in a new region, known as "Galar," and it features the new art style that looks similar to the "Pokémon Let\'s Go!" games that ari ved in late 2018. It also features new Pokémon, new trainers, and a totally new story.\nWith a launch window set for late 2019, "Pokémon Sword" and "Pokémon Shield" are likely to be the biggest Nintendo games of the year.', 'E3 2018 hasn\'t even officially begun yet, but we\'ve already seem some awesome teasers and trailers for upcoming games - and we\'ve 
collected them all in one place. The weekend got started with EA\'s press conference on Saturday, with presentations to follow from Microsoft, Bethesda and Devolver Digital on Sunday, and then Square Enix, Ubisoft and Sony on Monday.

Gears 5 is set for release on Xbox One and PC in 2019.\nSet in 1724 Japan, Ghost of Tsushima is an open-world action game from Sucker Punch, who previously developed the Infamous series.
